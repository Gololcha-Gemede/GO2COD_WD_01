# GO2COD_WD_01
A To-do-list app that has functionalities like: adding ,deleting and editing.
For this project I have used web development technologies like HTML,CSS and React.
The user can type into the input field and click the add button to add a task. Then the added task will be rendered along with different buttons to manipulate the added task.
